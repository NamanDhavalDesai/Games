# Games
This repository is to store the games programmed in java.  
(My first hands on project).  
(Created in 2015 using BlueJ at the age of 14).  
This repository conatains one program (.java) that consists of 9 games:   
1) Hangman.
2) X and 0.
3) Jumble words.
4) Cricket.
5) Chess
6) Guess the code.
7) Battleships.
8) Connect 4.
9) Othello.

All in one program. Used different functions (one or more for each game) within the same class and called a particular function (depending on teh choice made by the user) in the main function using conditional branching. This programs contains over 34 functions and 8500 lines of program. The program does not contain any GUI and only the backend code and basic printing using the print statements to view the output and play the game.
